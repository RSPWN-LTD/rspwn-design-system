## Brand Guidelines

### Typography Usage
- ‚úÖ Use Audiowide ONLY for brand name "RSPWN" and major headings
- ‚úÖ Use Inter for all body text and secondary headings
- ‚úÖ Maintain proper hierarchy and contrast
- ‚ùå Never use Audiowide for body text or long content

### Color Usage
- ‚úÖ Primary Blue (#4A9EFF) exclusively for primary actions and key interactive elements
- ‚úÖ Maintain professional grayscale hierarchy for content structure
- ‚úÖ White text (#FFFFFF) for primary content, grays for secondary information
- ‚ùå Avoid decorative color usage in titles or non-functional elements

### Design Principles
- **Professional Polish**: Clean, refined interfaces without unnecessary visual effects
- **Systematic Consistency**: Rigorous adherence to spacing, typography, and color systems
- **Accessibility First**: High contrast ratios and semantic structure throughout
- **Purposeful Color**: Strategic use of blue accent for primary actions only
- **Enterprise Ready**: Business-appropriate aesthetics suitable for professional gaming platforms
